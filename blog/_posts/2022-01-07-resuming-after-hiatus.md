title: Resuming after a long hiatus
categories: blog
---

I have updated my site after a long time. Almost 8 years.
Lot of life happened in the mean while.

I have worked in two startups, and one got acquired.
Now I am employed with a large organisation.

Covid happened, which has turned life upside down for entire world.

I got married. My friends got married.
I moved cities.

Travelled a bit as well.

Hoping to continue the streak of writing blogs on regular basis now.

And to whoever is reading, Wish you a very Happy New Year.
