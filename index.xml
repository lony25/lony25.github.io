  <title>A beutiful adieu to 2024 Cinema</title>

<p>Last 2024 sun has set in every part of the world and a new year is beckoning us with new promises.<br>
To everyone reading this, wish you a very Happy New Year.</p>
<p>While another year has gone, I continue on my path to watch movies as year before that and before that. Not a lot of movies are worth talking about. And not all movies I watch are released in that year itself.<br>
As time devoted to this pursuit has wavered, I have to be more judicious on my consumption.</p>
<p>With that preamble out of way, this is about a beautiful movie in 2024 that I ended up watching during the last days of 2024.</p>
<section id="meiyazhagan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meiyazhagan">Meiyazhagan</h2>
<p>This is Tamil language movie starring two stalwarts of Indian cinema: <strong>Arvind Swamy</strong> and <strong>Karthi</strong>.<br>
<!--break--> Story is simple - a person returns to their native town after a long time to attend a wedding and meets a relative about whom he has forgotten. But simplest stories pulls you in, makes you experience every single frame, every single dialogue, background score.</p>
<section id="cinematography" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cinematography">Cinematography</h3>
<p>I am a hobbyist photographer. So I like a frame when it is beautifully shot. I love static long shots. They let you in seamlessly in the frame, observe the nuances, colors, lightning, shadow.<br>
For example there is one specific instance in the movie, where Arvind’s character is mad with Karthi’s. So he asked to be dropped to a lodging facility. They ride on scooter, and stop bang in the middle of the road. Karthi is waiting on his scotter in the middle of the scooter with soft yellow street light while Arvind visits lodges on either side of road and comes out gagging. That scene is such a brilliant scene with its symmetrical framing with Karthi being the middle point, there is background night activities and Arvind stumbling from both sides one after another.<br>
There are many such example in the movie where framing is masterfully and thoughtfully done. Another shot is Arvind laying food for all the parrots on his terrace just after the prologue. It is very bright shot but the color contrast provided by green parrots eating food draws your eyes away from the brightness of the morning.</p>
</section>
<section id="background-score" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-score">Background Score</h3>
<p>I am not a native Tamil speaker so while I did like the music and songs, I couldn’t understand the impact of the lyrics. The english subtitles don’t quite capture the emotion portrayed in the songs. But with background score, there is no such issue.<br>
Highlight of it was the emotional reunion scene between Arvind and his sister. Although, I dislike slow motion in general - I believe it has been overdone to death now - I think it was apprpriate at that stage and didn’t feel too slow either. A simple exchange of anklets but so impactful.</p>
</section>
<section id="dialogues" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dialogues">Dialogues</h3>
<p>These were the highlights even when I am not a native speaker. After a long time, I have seen a movie that is so much driven by the dialogues between characters. Arvind’s annoyed but polite responses to Karthi’s cheerfulness was an amzing contrast. And conversation flow was smooth. It never felt like characters are forced to say something to move the plot forward.</p>
</section>
<section id="screenplay" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="screenplay">Screenplay</h3>
<p>Story was simple, but screenplay was exquisite. There was underlying drama of relatives cheating the protaganist’s family of the ancestral wealth and but it remained as backdrop. There was no focred romance - just two man who love their families and wives.<br>
There was ample opportunity to delve into the history and karmic balance of the central point of main character’s aloofness to his extended relatives but it never became the focal point. I believe, there was just one shot that showed those relatives.<br>
The conversation was always between Karthi and Arvind, and their shared memories and connections with city.</p>
</section>
<section id="performances" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performances">Performances</h3>
<p>Arvind’s performance was masterful. His restricted struggling man who has fond memories of a place but bitter end draws you in. You want to root for that person to reconnect with his town, his better relatives. You understand his motivations of getting out that place ASAP but also understand his quite walks around his old house.<br>
Karthi’s on the other hand was abundandlty cheerful. He played his character with energy, who is happy in his life and has done better than ever hoped for. He makes for the fun quotient of the film. One scene stands out where he salutes the cobra in the backyard where earlier he stated that they are harmless while his wife worries sick.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-verdict" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-verdict">Final verdict</h3>
<p>Watch it without increasing the speed of playback, without skipping the songs and if possible in a single sitting. Watch it for the artists at the peak of their craft and admire on what is possible. You don’t always need heavy CGI, action, romance or plot twists - sometimes simple conversations are enough.<br>
All of us would either know or have felt like Arvind’s character in some moments of our life. Finding a Karthi to ground us and make us remmeber our good nature would be a blessing.</p>
<p>This movie is available on Netflix India.</p>

  <title>Automate your trivial stuff</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>One of the interesting perks of being part of large organization finding out that you have access to the tools that have power to simplify your life. One such tool I cam across recently while searching for a solution to a problem I had: MS PowerAutomate.</p>
<section id="problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Let me first begin with the problem: I had to remind a certain group of people to work on a task every friday. Task was to fill an excel sheet, but it could have been anything: updating JIRA board, updating presentation, finishing PR review. Broadly, requirement was: - <em>Recurring email with fixed body sent to group of people</em></p>
<!--break-->
<p>##Solutions</p>
<p>While looking for solutions, few things came to mind: - Can we use Outlook or email client, to automate it - Should I send an email or create a Slack channel to remind in it - Any free, legal tool already present that does this - Should I write quick and dirty script to do this</p>
<p>On further probing each of above in more details, few points emerged: - There is no apparaent solution. And I didn’t want to spend to go through lot of documentation, undocumented features to see if it is possible. It was too much of time sink for a problem not that high on priority. - People mute and ignore slack channels. It has to be the email. Creating rules to filter an email still takes a bit more time as well as mail priority could be changed, text could be changed. - Any such tools are not present on cursory search on google. - It won’t be a quick script. It can’t be dirty or else I would be fighting myself 6 months down the line. There might also be permission issues or legal issues in achieving this.</p>
<p>While I was searching for automated way in Outlook, I came across few blogs that mentioned PowerAutomate. Since it is a Microsoft product, it occured to me that it might be present in MS bundle that is available and I might use it with my business user.</p>
<p>And voila, it is.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<p>So started the next phase of creating this solution. Once I logged in, it was time to investiage the UI and find out out to build my solution. Below, I have created step by step guide to create this solution. It is not super complicated but might help someone who do not want to spend lot of time on it.</p>
<p>Once you log in, go to <em>Create Flow</em> <img src="https://www.lony.in/tech/2022/01/10/create.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Create Flow"></p>
<p>Select a <em>Scheduled Cloud Flow</em> <img src="https://www.lony.in/tech/2022/01/10/cloud_flow.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Scheduled Cloud Flow"></p>
<p>Give it a name and schedule it. And click on Create.</p>
<p>Add a <em>step</em> on it. <img src="https://www.lony.in/tech/2022/01/10/nextstep.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Add Step"></p>
<p>In Choose operation, select <em>Email</em> <img src="https://www.lony.in/tech/2022/01/10/emailtemp.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Email template"></p>
<p>Add content in email, recipients <img src="https://www.lony.in/tech/2022/01/10/email.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Email"></p>
<p>And click on save. Once saved, do a test run for it <img src="https://www.lony.in/tech/2022/01/10/test.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Test"></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the result, save it and validate on your next scheduled run.</p>
