<div class="message">	
     Hello World !!
</div>

In this post, I want to list out all the steps I went through to finally put up this site.

There were more than one resources, and more than one site that I scavenged to properly
set up the site.

This is on going effort, as I don't recall all the steps, tutorials, site and other resources
I went through to finally be able to put this together.
